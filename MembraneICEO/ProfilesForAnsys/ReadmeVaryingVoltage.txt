Varying Voltage files -- CKH Sept 28
These profiles are for a 10 micron long, 400 nm diameter pore.
I ran 30, 60, 90,120 and 150V.

A spot check of these profiles shows that the calculated wall velocities go as the square of the applied voltages. That is, between 30 and 60V, the wall velocity jumps by a factor of 4. Between 30 and 120V, the wall velocity increases by a factor of 16.(In reality the high electric fields here put things way into the non linear zeta potential regime).

It's important to note we probably don't get such a large voltage drop across the 10 micron pore.
 Because the electrodes are at least a few mm from the pore entrances, the voltage drop across the pore is likely to be smaller, maybe even in the 1V range with tens of applied volts. But, the voltage drop along the pore will go linearly with the applied voltage. Meaning, if it's actually 1V at 100 applied volts on the electrode, it's 2V at 200 applied volts (until something breaks down). The slope of the pressure-vs-voltage plot is still of interest even if these simulated pressures and voltages are too high.

One geometry file is included, it's the same as the one we already have for the 400 nm pore.
